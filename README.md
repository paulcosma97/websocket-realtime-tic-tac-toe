# XO Multiplayer Web Game

## Short Description

A simple game that I made to learn about web sockets.

It can show you your connection status, the online players and their open rooms. You can join or create a room, wait for other players to join and play.

For the communication between the client and the server I used an action/message based system, similar to Redux.

To create this project, I used React with Hooks, Web Sockets, Node.js with Express and Typescript.
